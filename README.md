# UFOs

## Overview of Project

This project was used showcase the use of JavaScript filters by allowing users to input filter parameters and then displaying that filtered information on a webpage. Specifically, we had to create a webpage that would allow users to filter through UFO data.

## Results
To use the website the user simply has to input search criteria under the filter search area, and once the hits enter the table of data will display the filtered data.

To clear the filters, delete all of the criteria from the boxes.

## Summary
One drawback of this design is that it has very specific input parameters for the input data. In the future I would recommend building a more robust search criteria to accomodate for the search function that is in place now. I would also recommend populating the data with more dates, is it currently only goes into the first two weeks of 2010.
